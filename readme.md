## 1. Background

A traffic counter is an electronic device used to count, classify, and/or measure the speed of vehicular traffic passing along a given roadway. Typically deployed near the roadway, it uses on-road media such as pneumatic road tubes, piezo-electric sensors, or inductive loops to detect passing vehicles. Pneumatic road tubes are generally used for temporary studies, while piezo-electric sensors and inductive loops are employed for permanent studies to analyze seasonal traffic trends and monitor congestion on major roads.

With advancements in technology, video processing can now be used to count and classify motor vehicles.

## 2. Objectives

1. **Research deep learning methods:**  
   Explore various deep learning approaches for counting pedestrians and vehicles using cameras. Compare and select the most suitable method.

2. **Object detection datasets:**  
   Search for vehicle (car, truck, bus, bike) and pedestrian object detection datasets. Optionally, create your own dataset. Develop and train a deep learning model capable of detecting vehicles and pedestrians from live or recorded video. Transfer learning may be used to enhance the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.

3. **System implementation at UWI main gate:**  
   Deploy the system to count pedestrians and vehicles entering or leaving the campus. The constraints and limitations of the setup will be determined in collaboration with the supervisor. Analyze the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC, and AUC curves.

4. **Communication system design:**  
   Implement a communication system to store and display counting data on a website. Additionally, design a solar PV system, communication system, and enclosure to support the device in remote locations (this will not be implemented during the project).

## 3. Implementation and Methodology

The design will use customized or existing deep learning models. Transfer learning can also be leveraged in this project. The student and supervisor will define the required hardware to train the model and run the application. A basic website will be used for storing and viewing counting data.
