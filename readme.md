1.1 Background

 

A traffic counter is an electronic device used to count, classify, and/or measure the speed of vehicular traffic passing along a given roadway. The device is usually deployed close to the roadway and uses an on-road medium, such as pneumatic road tubes laid across the roadway, piezo-electric sensors embedded in the roadway, inductive loops cut into the roadway, or a combination of these to detect the passing vehicles. Pneumatic road tubes are generally used for temporary studies to study a traffic sample. In contrast, piezo-electric sensors and inductive loops are used for permanent studies, which can ascertain seasonal traffic trends and are often used in congestion monitoring on major roads.

The advancement of technology has now made it possible to use video processing technology to count and classify motor vehicles.
1.2 Objectives

    1.  Research to determine the different deep-learning methods used to count pedestrians and vehicles using a camera. Compare and contrast them and select the most suitable method.
    2. Search online resources for vehicle (car, truck, bus, bike) and pedestrian object detection datasets. Create your dataset also.
    Research, develop, and train a deep learning model on the vehicle and pedestrian object detection datasets. The model should be able to detect vehicles and pedestrians from a live video feed or recorded video. Transfer learning could be used to train a model with good accuracy, precision, and recall scores. 
    3. Implement a system and install it at the UWI main gate. The system should count pedestrians and vehicles entering or leaving the campus. The student and        supervisor will determine the constraints and limitations of the setup. Analyse the trained model to determine metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1     score, ROC and AUC curves.

    4.  Design and implement a communication system that allows the counting data to be stored and viewed on a website.
        Design a solar PV system, communication system and enclosure that will be needed to implement the device in a remote location. This part of the system will not be implemented in the project.

1.3 Implementation and Methodology
The design should use customised or existing deep learning models. Transfer learning can also be used in this project. The student and supervisor will determine the hardware needed to train the model and run the application. A basic website can be used to store the counting data.
